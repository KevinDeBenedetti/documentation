[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a lightweight tool to manage Python virtual environments and project dependencies. It provides a simple CLI to create and manage isolated .venv environments, synchronize dependencies deterministically, run commands inside the environment, and manage a local cache.

We use uv in this project documentation and examples to ensure reproducible development environments and to simplify common workflows.

Why use uv instead of pip alone?
- Automatic creation and management of .venv environments.
- Deterministic sync of dependencies (reduces "works on my machine" issues).
- Built-in caching and offline-friendly behavior for faster installs.
- Unified commands (uv venv, uv sync, uv run, uv cache) that replace multiple manual pip/venv steps.

### Install

```sh
# Initialize a new uv project
uv init --app

# Add FastAPI as a dependency
uv add fastapi --extra standard

# Run the FastAPI development server
uv run fastapi dev
```

### Common Commands

```sh
# Project initialization
uv init                   # Initialize a new project
uv init --app             # Initialize with application structure

# Dependency management
uv add <package>          # Add a dependency
uv add <package> --dev    # Add a development dependency
uv remove <package>       # Remove a dependency
uv sync                   # Sync dependencies from lockfile

# Environment management
uv venv                   # Create a virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.12     # Create with specific Python version

# Running commands
uv run <command>          # Run command in the project environment
uv run python script.py   # Run Python script
uv run fastapi dev        # Run FastAPI development server

# Package information
uv tree                   # Show dependency tree
uv list                   # List installed packages

# Cache management
uv cache clean            # Clear the cache
uv cache dir              # Show cache directory
```

### Configuration

```sh
[project]
name = "my-fastapi-app"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi[standard]>=0.100.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "httpx>=0.24.0",
    "black>=23.0.0",
    "ruff>=0.1.0",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```
