[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a lightweight and high-performance tool designed to manage Python virtual environments and project dependencies.

## Why use UV instead of pip alone?

::list{type="success"}
- **Automatic management**: Automatic creation and management of `.venv` environments
- **Deterministic sync**: Eliminates "works on my machine" problems
- **Optimized performance**: Built-in cache and offline mode for faster installs
::

## Quick start

```sh
# Initialize a new uv project
uv init --app my-project

# Move into the project
cd my-project

# Add FastAPI as a dependency
uv add fastapi --extra standard

# Run the FastAPI dev server
uv run fastapi dev
```

## Recommended workflow

### Project initialization

Create a new project with the appropriate structure:

```sh
# Initialize the project
uv init --app my-project
```

### Environment configuration

Set up your virtual environment:

```sh
# Create the environment with Python 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12
```

## Best practices

- **Lock your versions**: Use `uv lock` and `uv sync` to ensure all team members use the same dependency versions. Always commit the `uv.lock` file.
- **Optimized cache**: UV's local cache speeds up repeated installs and enables offline work. The cache is shared across projects.
