## Fail2ban

Fail2ban is an intrusion prevention tool designed to block IP addresses used by bots or attackers attempting to compromise your system. Its primary goal is to detect and mitigate unauthorized access attempts. This package is highly recommended, and in some cases essential, to strengthen your server's security against attacks such as brute-force login attempts or Denial of Service (DoS) style attacks.
